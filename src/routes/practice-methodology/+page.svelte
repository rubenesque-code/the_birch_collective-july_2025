				Policies & Practices
			</h2>

			<div class="mt-[20px]">
				<p class="">
					The Birch Collective works to the model of a community mental health intervention.
					Community-based interventions are strategies that aim to promote mental health and
					wellbeing in the context of people's everyday lives, by engaging local resources,
					networks, and cultures. Community building is the strength with which we use to facilitate
					and deepen participants' sense of belonging, purpose and resilience. Research suggests
					that belonging, purpose and resilience are protective factors against poor wellbeing, and
					this is particularly important during transitions from adolescence to adulthood.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-4">
					The following sections outline the context within which our community based approach sits,
					from our local context to a wider national scale. Underpinned by an understanding of our
					context, we aim to provide an early intervention service that centres around therapeutic
					intervention strategies, offering a therapeutic service. We are aware that, whilst
					traditional therapies and child, adolescent and adult mental health services have their
					place for many, there are also many for whom require a different approach to support. For
					some, experiences with traditional support services may have been problematic. For others,
					whilst in need of additional support, they may not meet the traditional thresholds to gain
					access to these services. Our inclusive, long-term, therapeutic, community-based approach
					aims to fill this gap.

				<h3 class="font-medium">Bristol Deprivation</h3>
				<p class="mt-4">
					Statistics from 2019 show that 15% of Bristol’s population lived in the most deprived 10%
					of areas in England. 14% of the total population of Bristol were found to suffer from
					income deprivation, and the percentage of people who are struggling financially has
					continuously increased over the past three years. Within this, around 17,200 children and
					young people (21% of children and young people) in Bristol lived in income deprived
					households. Employment deprivation similarly has increased, and the statistics showed that
					around 10% of working age people (29,600) are employment deprived. There is also
					significant disparity between the deprivation levels across Bristol. Bristol continues to
					have deprivation ‘hotspots’ that are amongst some of the most deprived areas in the
					country, yet are adjacent to some of the least deprived areas in the country. This means
					that the inequality gap is substantial, with access to opportunities, experiences and
					services greatly unequal between adjacent areas. Birch aims to address this gap, by
					operating in those areas that are most vulnerable to deprivation. By holding our core
					programmes in these locations, we increase the accessibility of our services to young
					people who live within them.

				<h3 class="mt-8 font-medium">Wider Context</h3>

				<p class="mt-4">
					On a national level, research suggests that, regardless of individuals histories and
					backgrounds, the years between mid-teens and mid-20s are significantly more vulnerable to
					developing mental health concerns, with around half of all lifetime mental health problems
					found to have started by the mid-teens, and three-quarters by the mid-20s. A <a
						href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/mental-health-of-children-and-young-people-in-england/2017/2017"
						target="_blank"
					>
						survey of the mental health of children and young people in England
					</a>
					found that 12.5% of 5 to 19 year olds had at least one mental health disorder when assessed,
					and 5% met the criteria for 2 or more mental health disorders. We aim to address this at Birch
					through targeting our programmes and services specifically for those between the ages of 16-25.
				</p>

				<p class="mt-4">
					Research also suggests that 16-25 year olds are particularly vulnerable to experiencing
					feelings of loneliness and isolation, and that this in itself can prompt and heighten
					mental health and wellbeing concerns for this age range.
				</p>

				<p class="mt-4">
					The Covid-19 pandemic has significantly contributed to and exasperated feelings of
					loneliness and isolation amongst young people. A survey from the Autumn 2020 cohort of
					16yr olds (now 19-20 yr olds) - found that most participants experienced sudden and
					complete loss of social contact with peers. Those impacted most severely were young people
					with pre-existing mental health conditions; young people who receive additional support
					with learning; those living in households where there is violence and abuse; young carers;
					those living in a family where someone had developed long Covid, and members of some
					minority groups, such as LGBT+
				</p>
				<p class="mt-4">
					Nearly all participants surveyed felt there had not been enough support in terms of mental
					health and well-being for young people. Negative mental health impacts of the pandemic may
					be experienced more severely by those young people already isolated, and more vulnerable
					to risk. A commitment to see all behaviour as communication, combined with recognition of
					the value of the insights to be gained from listening to young people themselves, is
					necessary, and is something which we prioritise at Birch.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-4">
					In addition to this, 16-25 year olds are also particularly vulnerable to mental health and
					wellbeing concerns due to the transitional period to adulthood which they are
					experiencing. Once again, transition periods are even more likely to prove challenging for
					those young people that already accessed traditional mental health services in their
					childhood or adolescence. The point of transition from child and adolescent support
					services for mental health, to adult services, is potentially a time of upheaval for young
					people. Young people may find it difficult to navigate new service settings or to manage
					their mental health and wellbeing following discharge from child and adolescent services,
					especially as the availability and type of support can change dramatically.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-4">
					There are also significant risks of young people disengaging or being lost in the
					transition process. This can result in young adults presenting again in crisis or with a
					greater severity of need later in life. Transitions for vulnerable groups, such as those
					within the criminal justice system, can be particularly problematic. They require close
					engagement with the young person and, where appropriate, their families/carers.

				<p class="mt-4">
					Isolation can also be exasperated through educational and employment exclusion. Once
					again, those already most disadvantaged are more likely to experience educational and
					employment exclusion, and therefore experience more adverse impacts of isolation. Boys and
					young people from disadvantaged backgrounds (i.e. low socio-economic status, deprived
					neighbourhoods, etc), and Black Caribbean and students with special educational needs
					status are significantly more likely to be excluded from school, and permanently excluded
					students are more likely to experience worse health and well-being outcomes. A recent
					national study found that permanently excluded pupils reported higher levels of life
					dissatisfaction and had a higher reporting of lifestyle behaviours that negatively impact
					on health. As well as this, school exclusion increased the risk of becoming NEET at the
					age of 19/20, and then remaining economically inactive at the age of 25/26, as well as
					experiencing higher unemployment risk and earning lower wages also at the age of 25/26. In
					2023, the percentage of the population of 16-24 year olds defined as ‘not in education,
					employment or training’ (NEET) was estimated to be 41.6% , an increase from previous
					years.

				<p class="">It is widely acknowledged that the foundations for wellbeing include:</p>

				<p class="mt-4">
					Our approach to wellbeing, centred around a community building strengths based-approach,
					aims to address these foundations, through our core and fundamental mission to deepen
					participants' sense of belonging, purpose and resilience. We do this through an early
					intervention model that provides preventative solutions and a passion for lifelong
					learning to enable people to reach their potential. We are not Therapists, but offer a
					therapeutic approach to interventions. We prioritise inclusive practices, where everyone
					feels safe and welcomed. As well as this, the programmes and services that we offer are
					designed specifically to facilitate long-term support, so that even past the age of 26,
					participants can continue to engage with a variety of opportunities.

			<h2 class="text-bc-slate-pine font-display mt-4 text-[44px] font-bold">Early intervention</h2>

			<div class="mt-[20px]">
				<p class="">
					Early intervention can take many forms. The support that someone needs won’t always be
					‘clinical’, and it’s important that we don’t over-medicalise people’s experience of
					distress. The ‘right’ support will depend on someone’s individual needs, how those needs
					affect them, the severity of their symptoms, their individual strengths, and their wider
					circumstances. In some cases, interventions which encourage people to access activities
					which improve mood and wellbeing such as the arts, physical activity, or nature, may be
					most effective.
				</p>

				<p class="mt-4">
					For us at Birch, our early intervention model provides preventative solutions and a
					passion for lifelong learning to enable people to reach their potential. There is a lack
					of transition services between adolescent and adult mental health provision. This age
					group has specific needs and our community mental health model lacks the appearance of a
					service, removing barriers to engagement. With the Green Social Prescribing trial, a
					different approach to mental health provision is developing and services such ours are
					pioneering a nature-based approach, tailored to young adults.
				</p>

				<p class="mt-4">
					Whilst our programmes are suitable for anyone seeking to spend more time outdoors and meet
					new people, our programmes are specifically suitable for those struggling with family and
					relationship issues, struggling to engage with study, socially and emotionally isolated,
					those not in education, employment or training and those experiencing mental health
					concerns. Participants are able to self-refer for attendance, however we do have some key
					referral pathways through organisations in the city, such as 16-25 Independent People, .
					As such, many of our participants may come to us through referrals which include
					significant detail around the participants background, which often includes any mental
					health, special educational need, and family circumstance labels and diagnoses. Whilst to
					provide inclusive practices and accessibility we do take into account any required
					adjustments participants may need, however we also take great care to ensure that we see
					beyond any labels assigned to them throughout their experiences with other services and
					instead see all of our participants as empowered, unique individuals with ownership and
					authority over how they wish to present themselves to us.

			<div class="mt-[20px]">
				<p class="">
					We actively target people who are under-represented in nature-based groups to access our
					services, beyond those that live in the vicinity. We ensure inclusivity through all our
					offers being free at point of contact. With trusted referral pathways with a range of
					youth services across the city, statutory and non-stat, we reach many who would not
					ordinarily access either green spaces or MH services. Our community MH model is activity
					focussed, eroding stigma.
				</p>

				<p class="mt-4">
					The groups we run are fully inclusive of all types of needs. Our team is experienced at
					working with a wide range of presentations. In conversation with participants and their
					support network, we ascertain if what we offer is the right path for them.
				</p>

				<p class="mt-4">
					We find a culture of tolerance and celebration of difference adds richness to our groups.
					We openly discuss the edges of this during sessions and encourage consideration of how one
					anothers difficulties affect us and how one might respond, with compassion for self and
					others.
				</p>

				<p class="mt-4">
					Our referral pathways, our Therapeutic Forest School sessions with the ESOL department and
					partner work with OTR ensure that we reach minority ethnic groups. Consequently we access
					many who face socio-economic and cultural barriers to engagement. Our work with OTR and
					Bristol College particularly focuses on young refugees and asylum seekers. These bespoke
					courses, alongside the individual therapeutic benefit, promote a realisation that they are
					welcome at our other programmes and we actively encourage longer term engagement to our
					year-round programs. We provide both reimbursement of travel expenses and food to further
					facilitate and encourage engagement.
				</p>

				<p class="mt-4">
					With advice from our steering group, we are altering our marketing materials to actively
					state that we welcome specific groups with protected characteristics.
				</p>

				<p class="mt-4">
					Our ambition is to be a truly anti-racist organisation, where we acknowledge and challenge
					racism where needed, educate ourselves and others about the impact this has on our
					communities and seek representation at all levels of our organisation.
