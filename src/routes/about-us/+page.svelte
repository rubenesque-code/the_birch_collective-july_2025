			`We run outdoor group experiences that bring you closer to nature ðŸŒ³, yourself âœ¨, and others. Our sessions are about more than just spending time outsideâ€”theyâ€™re about building a community where everyone is accepted for who they are. Youâ€™ll learn practical skills, like how to grow your own food or create something beautiful from natural materials, all while connecting with others who understand what youâ€™re going through.`,
			`Weâ€™re not a traditional support group. Instead, we focus on crafting a safe space where you can explore, play, and develop the resilience to face lifeâ€™s challenges ðŸ’ª. We believe that by grounding ourselves in nature and learning from each other, we can find strength, purpose, and a sense of belonging.`

	<TextSection
		title="Why We Started"
		body={[
			`The Birch Collective was born during the Covid-19 pandemic, when isolation hit hard for many. We saw how connecting with nature and spending time with othersâ€”even virtuallyâ€”helped people cope. What started as online conversations grew into weekly outdoor meet-ups, and now, weâ€™re here with you in person every week with Fresh Air Thursdays and more.`

	<TextSection
		title="Our Approach"
		body={[
			`ðŸŒ¿ Weâ€™re all about belonging. We believe that being rooted in your community and feeling connected to nature can make a huge difference. Thatâ€™s why we create spaces where you can feel seen, heard, and valued.`,
			`ðŸŽ¨ Weâ€™re also focused on playâ€”exploring your creativity and curiosity through fun, adventurous activities. Whether itâ€™s learning land skills or just enjoying a walk with new friends, we believe in the joy of discovery.`,
			`ðŸ’¡ At the heart of it all is empowerment. Weâ€™re here to help you feel inspired and explore your passions, unlocking the gifts you already have within yourself.`,
			`ðŸŒŸ Join Us: If youâ€™re between 16 and 25 and looking for something differentâ€”whether itâ€™s new friends, new skills, or a deeper connection with natureâ€”weâ€™d love to meet you. Join us for one of our sessions, and letâ€™s explore how we can build a better future together.`
