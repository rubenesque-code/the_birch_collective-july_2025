			<p class="mt-8 text-xl leading-relaxed">
				We run outdoor group experiences that bring you closer to nature ðŸŒ³, yourself âœ¨, and
				others. Our sessions are about more than just spending time outsideâ€”theyâ€™re about building a
				community where everyone is accepted for who they are. Youâ€™ll learn practical skills, like
				how to grow your own food or create something beautiful from natural materials, all while
				connecting with others who understand what youâ€™re going through.
			</p>

			<p class="mt-4 text-xl leading-relaxed">
				Weâ€™re not a traditional support group. Instead, we focus on crafting a safe space where you
				can explore, play, and develop the resilience to face lifeâ€™s challenges ðŸ’ª. We believe that
				by grounding ourselves in nature and learning from each other, we can find strength,
				purpose, and a sense of belonging.

			<h2 class="font-display text-bc-slate-pine text-6xl font-bold">Why We Started</h2>

			<p class="mt-8 text-xl leading-relaxed">
				The Birch Collective was born during the Covid-19 pandemic, when isolation hit hard for
				many. We saw how connecting with nature and spending time with othersâ€”even virtuallyâ€”helped
				people cope. What started as online conversations grew into weekly outdoor meet-ups, and
				now, weâ€™re here with you in person every week with Fresh Air Thursdays and more.

			<p class="mt-8 text-xl leading-relaxed">
				ðŸŒ¿ Weâ€™re all about belonging . We believe that being rooted in your community and feeling
				connected to nature can make a huge difference. Thatâ€™s why we create spaces where you can
				feel seen, heard, and valued.
			</p>

			<p class="mt-4 text-xl leading-relaxed">
				ðŸŽ¨ Weâ€™re also focused on play â€”exploring your creativity and curiosity through fun,
				adventurous activities. Whether itâ€™s learning land skills or just enjoying a walk with new
				friends, we believe in the joy of discovery.
			</p>
			<p class="mt-4 text-xl leading-relaxed">
				ðŸ’¡At the heart of it all is empowerment. Weâ€™re here to help you feel inspired and explore
				your passions, unlocking the gifts you already have within yourself.
			</p>
			<p class="mt-4 text-xl leading-relaxed">
				ðŸŒŸ Join Us If youâ€™re between 16 and 25 and looking for something differentâ€”whether itâ€™s new
				friends, new skills, or a deeper connection with natureâ€”weâ€™d love to meet you. Join us for
				one of our sessions, and letâ€™s explore how we can build a better future together.
